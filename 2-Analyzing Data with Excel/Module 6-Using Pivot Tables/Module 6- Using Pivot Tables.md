# Module 6: Using Pivot Tables

## To begin Format the Excel sheet as a table

​	(Don't forget to select "my table has headers") -Once you do this you'll notice the table has filters

​		When you add a new row, it will automatically be formatted as a table

## To open Pivot table, select any cell in the table, then on the insert tab, click PivotTable

​	Select a **'table or range**', Table 1 should already be entered (If you haven't just created table you will need to select the cells by placing them in the range)

Selecting 'New Worksheet' is the most common

Using the Pivot table fields you will set-up your table

You can use the drop-downs in the fields to the right to change the format

Next, we’ll add a calculated field from the ‘PivotTable Analyze’ tab, using the **‘Fields, Items & Sets’** button.

Here you will insert the Name and Formula you wish to use

## Features:

When you chose a cell, under **'insert'** hit **'recommended Pivot Table**' and a menu will appear based on the information contained in the cell

After select a new page will open along with a pain to the right for 'Pivot Table Fields' like before

​	Notice, fields have already been added based on recommendations however you can still change the fields to make it your own

After you can manually expand any of the fields to reveal it's contents (or you can expand or collapse all of them at once too using the feature at the top)

At the top of each field you have filters built it you can use, or just like in the table you can clear the filters in the pivot table

## Slicers: 

Slicers are essentially on-screen graphical filter objects that enable you to filter your data using buttons.

From the PivotTable Analyze tab, we click Insert Slicer,... and then choose Insert Slicers from the menu that appears

On top of the slicer box you can multi select or clear all

When insert another slicer be sure to select the cell first...

**Note that slicers can also be added from the "Filters"group on the 'Insert' tab as well as from the PivotTable Analyze tab**

When using multi-select when you click on an item you are actually **DESELECTING** it

## Timelines:

A Timeline is another type of filter tool that enables you to filter specifically on date-related data in your pivot table.

1. This is a much quicker and more effective way of dynamically filtering by date, rather than having to create and adjust filters on your date columns.
2. We can add a Timeline for our pivot table either from the PivotTable Analyze tab, or from the Insert tab. (Again, make sure that you select a cell first)

You can also change the position by dragging and change the size as well

1. Timelines and Slicers have their own tabs in the ribbon when you select them, and their properties can be modified to change how they look and how they work.



**Use this Pivot Table checklist to ensure your data is in a fit state to make a Pivot Table:** 

- Format your data as a table for best results.
- Ensure column headings are correct, and there is only one header row, as these column headings become the field names in a Pivot Table.
- Remove any blank rows and columns, and try to eliminate blank cells also.
- Ensure value fields are formatted as numbers, and not text, and ensure date fields are formatted as dates, and not text.

**Arranging Pivot Tables with Filters and Recommended Tables:**

- You use the Pivot Table Fields pane to add and arrange data fields in your pivot table. 
- Recommended Pivot Tables are a list of suggested different combinations of data that could be used when creating a Pivot Table, based on the data selected in the worksheet. 

**Filters and Slicers:**

- Slicers are on-screen graphical filter objects that enable you to filter your data using buttons, which makes it easier to perform quick filtering of your pivot table data. 
- Timelines are another type of filter tool that enable you to filter specifically on date-related data in your pivot table. This is a much quicker and more effective way of dynamically filtering by date, rather than having to create and adjust filters on your date columns.

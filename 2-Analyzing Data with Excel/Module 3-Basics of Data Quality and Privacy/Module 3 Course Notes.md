# Module 3: Basics of Data Quality and Privacy 

## Five Traits of Good Data

​	Accuracy, Completeness, Reliability, Relevance and Timeliness

​		*Accuracy is the first and most significant aspect to data quality

​	The data set by removing duplicates, correcting formatting errors, and removing blank rows.

## Importing File Data with Excel

​	Excel works with .xlsx or .xls files and opens them as workbooks.

​		Excel can also use other formats like plain text, or comma-separated and tab-separated data 

​			Could be common .txt files or CSV files

## Importing process

​	Open file in excel, choose the file, open, then select from recently used list or Browse. 

​		When we open the file the "Text Import Wizard" Launches automatically

### 	It has detected it to be a "Delimited file" (one that has data fields separated by a character such as a comma or tab)

Select option 'My data has headers' (it gives us a min preview of the data in the preview box)

Click 'Next' to proceed

In step 2, select the delimiter that (character) that is separating the pieces of data

Note: Data preview now starts to show us what the imported data  will look like. 

​	Scroll across to ensure that data is going to look like you want

In step 3 we can set the data format for each column (you may accept the default 'General Format') and proceed with the import

## Editing After import

(You may fix the column size by selecting all of the columns and double clicking in between the column dividers)

**Columns we don't need:** Can remove by either using delete drop-down menu in the Cells group on the home tab and select Delete Sheet Columns or by (easier) selecting and right clicking a column and deleting it that way. 

**Add Column:** Select column to the right of where you want the new one, then right click the column and choose insert

**Delete Row:** Simply select the row, right-click and choose Delete

## Saving File

​	If you want to save the file as an Excel file, you can either ***choose File, Save As***, or you

​	*can click **Save As in the yellow tooltip that appeared at the top of the worksheet when***

​	***we imported the file, and then you would choose ‘Excel Workbook** (*.xlsx)’ in the ‘Save*

​	as type’ box.
